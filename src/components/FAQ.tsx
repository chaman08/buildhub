    {
      question: "How do I know the contractors are genuine and qualified?",

    },
    {
      question: "What happens after I receive bids from contractors?",
      answer: "Once you receive bids, you can review each contractor's profile, past work, ratings, and pricing. You can then communicate directly with your preferred contractors through our secure chat system to discuss details and finalize terms."
    },
    {
      question: "Is my contact information shared with contractors?",
      answer: "Your contact information is only shared when you choose to initiate contact with a contractor. Until then, all communication happens through our secure in-platform messaging system, protecting your privacy."
    },

      question: "How do payments work? Do I pay through the platform?",
      answer: "Currently, payments are handled directly between customers and contractors. We provide a secure communication channel for you to negotiate terms. We're working on integrated payment features for added security and convenience."

    {
      question: "What types of construction projects can I post?",

    },
    {
      question: "How long does it take to receive bids?",
      answer: "Most projects start receiving bids within 24-48 hours. The timeline depends on your project complexity, location, and the number of contractors available in your area. You typically receive multiple bids within a week."
    },
    {
      question: "Can I cancel a project after posting?",
      answer: "Yes, you can cancel or modify your project at any time before finalizing with a contractor. Simply log into your dashboard and manage your project status. We recommend informing interested contractors about any changes."
